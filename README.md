Sales-Data-Cleansing-and-Analysis ðŸ“Š
A robust data cleaning and preprocessing project using Python's Pandas library. This repository demonstrates core data analytics skills by transforming a raw, messy sales dataset into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format. It covers column standardization, duplicate removal, handling missing values, date formatting, text normalization, correcting errors, and type casting to transform messy raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets.

Key Features -
Handling Missing Data: Techniques to identify and fill null values in key columns like price and customer ID.

Duplicate Removal: Efficiently identifies and removes redundant rows to ensure data integrity.

Data Standardization: Standardizes inconsistent text formats (e.g., country names, product names) and corrects illogical values (e.g., negative quantities).

Data Type Conversion: Corrects data types for columns like dates and numbers to enable proper calculations and analysis.
